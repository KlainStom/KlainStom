# KlainStom

### Ideas (in no particular order)
- Instance groups for consistent appearance (BossBars, SideBars, ...)
- Chat pools (chat messages are visible to all players on an instance of the same pool)
- Named instance wrapper (manage instances through names instead of or in addition to UUIDs)
- Resource pack "compiler" (merging all translations, custom textures, sounds, new items added by other extensions into one resourcepack and deliver it to the players)
- Game engine (essentially a method of creating games with multiple instances as a layer of abstraction on top of minestom)
